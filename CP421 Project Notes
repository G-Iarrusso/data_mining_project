School College apparently doesnt really matter

Position is going to be limited to [ot,ol,og,c] because they normally have the same size and build. This makes the data more uniform
and will curb any skewing of the results.

Secondary analysis with the addition of conferences based on school location. 

It is common for some metrics to not be considered as a raw value when real world scouting takes place.

Initially going to be a binary classification. Then we can expand to multi-result algorithms if there's time. From there we'll try and 
predict pick number

As a general rule we're going to include data with missing values unless there are 3 or more values missing where we will discard it.

Another  thing to note for later analysis is that some stats are not as sought after as they once were

It should be noted that some studies found that quality linemen might be found throuout the draft
